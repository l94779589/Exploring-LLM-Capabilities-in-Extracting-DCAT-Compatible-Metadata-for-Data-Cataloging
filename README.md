Repository for the paper "Exploring LLM Capabilities in Extracting DCAT-Compatible Metadata for Data Cataloging"


All results presented in this paper are available as separate Excel files within the "Results" folder.

The Python scripts used to evaluate these results can be found in the "Evaluation_Code" folder. These scripts provide a detailed implementation of the methods described in the paper.

The results were achieved using the process automation software N8N which integrates LangChain (https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/). This software can be self-hosted at no cost, and the workflows utilized for each DCAT-property in this research are available in the "N8N_Workflows" folder. 
These workflows can be imported as JSON files for replication or further experimentation. For more information on hosting N8N, please refer to the official documentation: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting.

Additionally, all prompts used during the workflows are stored separately in the "prompts" folder for easy access and reference. 

The evaluated and used datasets are linked in the “Datasets_Utilized” file.
